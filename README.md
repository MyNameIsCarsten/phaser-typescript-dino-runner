# Dinosaur Runner Game

This project is a browser-based game developed using PhaserJS. It is inspired by the classic dinosaur runner game found in Google Chrome. The game features a dinosaur character that must jump over obstacles. The gameplay continues until the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, at which point the game displays a game over screen and offers an option to restart.
